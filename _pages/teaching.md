## Music

Passionate about classical and jazz music, I am also a pianist, and would like to share here some of the pieces I particularly like, and some that I play. 

# Composers:

- Rachmaninov (1873-1945) 
    - Prelude Op.32 n°10 in B-minor `pdf`(poster.pdf)
    - Etude tableau Op.33 n°7 in G-minor `pdf`(poster.pdf)

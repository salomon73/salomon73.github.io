Welcome to my Webpage! I recently graduated from [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) with a Master of Science in Theoretical Physics. I specialized in Plasma Physics, Quantum Physics and Astrophysics. I did my master's thesis at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory ([PPPL](https://www.pppl.gov)) under the supervision of Dr. Stuart R. Hudson. You can find the thesis PDF in the section <p>publications<p>.

[comment]: # Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header [comment]: # of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

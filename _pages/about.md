Welcome to my Webpage! I recently graduated from [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) with a Master of Science in Theoretical Physics. I specialized in Plasma Physics, Quantum Physics and Astrophysics. I did my master's thesis at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory ([PPPL](https://www.pppl.gov)) under the supervision of Dr. Stuart R. Hudson. You can find the thesis PDF in the section [misc. works](https://salomon73.github.io/misc.%20works/).

In my research, I focus mainly on Stellarators, their design and optimization, working on the vacuum field and on the magnetic coils. I also worked on trapped electron clouds in gyrotrons. Check out the Projects section to learn more about ongoing or future research.  

Below, you can find links to my Linkedin, GitHub and Orcid pages. Don't forget to check out the repositories section on this Webpage too!

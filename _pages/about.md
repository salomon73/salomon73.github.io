Welcome to my webpage! I am a doctoral assistant at the Swiss Plasma Center [SPC](https://www.epfl.ch/research/domains/swiss-plasma-center/). In my research, I focus mainly on the theory of bremsstrahlung, runaway electrons, and stellarator coil design. I am also fond of math, in particular differential geometry and differential geometry, and their potential applications to my field. 

Below, you can find links to my Linkedin, GitHub and Orcid pages.

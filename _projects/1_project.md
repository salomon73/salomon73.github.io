The rotational transform, iota, has been shown to be an important parameter in Stellarator design. We propose a novel approach to recover the on-axis rotational transform from variational principles, carrying the appropriate near-axis expansion of the magnetic action. 

A paper is currently being written and should be submitted or at least posted on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org) soon.

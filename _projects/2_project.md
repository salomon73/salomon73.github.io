The rotational transform, $$\iota$$, has been shown to be an important parameter in Stellarator design. We propose a novel approach to recover the on-axis rotational transform from variational principles, carrying the appropriate near-axis expansion of the magnetic action. 

$$ \iota =  \oint \frac{\frac{J_0(s)/2}{B_0(s)}- \tau(s) +\delta'(s)}{2 \cosh{\eta(s)}} ds $$, 
where $\tau$ denotes the torsion of the magnetic axis, $$J_0$$ and $$B_0$$ the lowest order current density and magnetic field resepctively, $$\delta$$ characterizes the ellipticity of flux surfaces and $$\eta$$  the rotation. $$s$$ is an parameter describing the axis and the integral is performed along the latter. 


A paper is currently being written and should be submitted or at least posted on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org) soon.

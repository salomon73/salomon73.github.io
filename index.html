<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>Welcome to my Webpage! I recently graduated from <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/en/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">EPFL</a> with a Master of Science in Theoretical Physics. I specialized in Plasma Physics, Quantum Physics and Astrophysics. I did my master’s thesis at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (<a href="https://www.pppl.gov" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PPPL</a>) under the supervision of Dr. Stuart R. Hudson. You can find the thesis PDF in the section publications.</p> <p>In my research, I focus mainly on Stellarators, their design and optimization, working on the vacuum field and on the magnetic coils. I also worked on trapped electron clouds in gyrotrons. Check out the Projects section to learn more about ongoing or future research!</p> <p>Below, you can find links to my Linkedin, GitHub and Orcid pages. Don’t forget to check out the repositories section on this Webpage too!</p> <p>Salomon</p> </body></html>
